> To realize that all your life- you know, all your love, all your hate, all your memory, all your pain- it was all the same thing. It was all a story. A story that you have about how the world operates. A story about reality. And like a lot of stories, there's **marketer** at the end of it!

Inspired from:
> To realize that all your life- you know, all your love, all your hate, all your memory, all your pain- it was all the same thing. It was all the same dream. A dream that you had inside a locked room. A dream about being a person. And like a lot of dreams there's a monster at the end of it.
